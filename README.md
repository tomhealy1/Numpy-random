## Asssignment outline:
The purpose of this assignment is to outline and explore the use of the numpy random package in 
data analytics. The jupyter notebook contains the tasks outlines in the [assignment](https://github.com/tomhealy1/Numpy-random/blob/master/ProgDA_Assignment%20(3).pdf). The instructions for running the notebook are below.

This assignment will use a number of different tools to carry out the tasks in the assignment. The tools we will use are:

Python - see instructions below on how to install:

* Pandas - Data Manipulation

* Numpy - numerical/computational operations

* Matplotlib - Data Visualisation

* Scipy (scipy.stats) - An additional numerical package (some extra distributions exist in Scipy)

* Seaborn - An additional data visuaisation package

## Instructions:

1. If you have not already done so, please download the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution) for Python 3.7.

2. Once you install Anaconda, the packages listed above should be installed also.

3. Go to https://github.com/tomhealy1/Numpy-random and download the repo

4. Navigate to the folder you saved the repo in using your CLI or terminal

5. Change Directory to the folder, for example:
- C:\Users\Teamwork\Desktop > ```cd C:\Users\Teamwork\Desktop\numpy```

6. You can now run the notebook using ```jupyter notebook``` command in the terminal

7. When opened, run all cells.
